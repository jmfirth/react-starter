# React Starter

This is a simple starter project for a React app.  It contains my typical architecture, library and tooling configurations along with minimum boilerplate for a single page application.

* SPA boilerplate
* ITCSS boilerplate
* Hot reloading
* Eslint settings
* TernJS configuration
* Redux, React Router and friends
